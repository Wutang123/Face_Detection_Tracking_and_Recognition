Project 3: Face Detection Tracking and Recognition

Due Dates:
    - Intermediate Presentation: 11/9/21
    - Final Presentation:        12/2/21

Task:
    - Detect, track and recognize your face in the live video.
    - Detect, track and recognize a second personâ€™s face.
    - Simultaneously detect, track and recognize both multiple faces.
    - Design your system so that the results of the live demo can be shown via zoom during class.

Questions:
- Determine the full field of view of your camera, and the angular resolution of the pixels?
- How far from the camera can your system accurately recognize your face?
- At the farthest distance (where recognition is consistently possible) what is the number of pixels across the face (both vertically and horizontally) ?
- What is the accuracy of the model on the training data? What is the accuracy estimated during test as a function of distance from your camera?
- What is the power, temperature, and resource utilization of the processing during operation ?
